## Making a Pull Request

- The pull request should have a useful title, like `Add [name of apprenticeship]` instead of `Update README`.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.

### Formatting

```markdown
- [Company/Apprenticeship Name](link to website with more information or overview) | City/Cities | Description of company/apprenticeship
```

- The link should not be to a direct link to the application page unless that's all that is available.
- Use [title-casing](https://capitalizemytitle.com/).
- Check your spelling and grammar using a tool like [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com).
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- Suggestions (apprenticeships or further resources) should be sorted **alphabetically**.
  - Most text editors have a built in sort function that makes this super easy.
- Suggestions should be categorized by the right country and also sorted alphabetically but with the United States showing first.
  - e.g. United States, England, Portugal, etc.
- The featured image should include the company's logo. Here's an example that uses the company logo in an office setting: [example](https://static.viget.com/careers/_540xAUTO_crop_center-center/Durham-entry.jpg?mtime=20180718173457). Please avoid any images that focus on individuals and show faces.

## Making a Pull Request

- The pull request should have a useful title, like `Add [name of apprenticeship]` instead of `Update README`.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.

### Add new file in `content/apprenticeships`

```markdown
---
company: "Company or Organization Name"
description: "1 to 2 sentence description about apprenticeship by this company or organization."
image: "/images/apprenticeships/company-name.jpeg"
link: "https://company-website.com"
location:
  - "London, UK"
  - "San Francisco, CA"
  - "City, State"
  - "City, Country"
---
```

- The link should not be to a direct link to the application page unless that's all that is available.
- Use [title-casing](https://capitalizemytitle.com/).
- Check your spelling and grammar using a tool like [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com).
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The featured image should include the company's logo. Here's an example that uses the company logo in an office setting: [example](https://static.viget.com/careers/_540xAUTO_crop_center-center/Durham-entry.jpg?mtime=20180718173457). Please avoid any images that focus on individuals and show faces.

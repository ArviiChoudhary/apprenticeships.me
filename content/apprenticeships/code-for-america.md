Code for America builds technology to help government services work for the people who need them most.

We're excited to launch our 2019 apprenticeship program cohort to provide a pathway for people early in their technical careers to get on the job training. We're looking for passionate mission driven folks who are looking for opportunities to grow their skills. The program is eight months, full-time, and paid, beginning in April 2019.

The application period for this apprenticeship program is January 14th - February 11th, 2019.

- You've recently graduated from a degree or bootcamp program
- You're returning to the workforce and want to get up-to-date on your tech skills
- You're early in your career and looking to gain more experience

Our ideal apprentice has a solid technical foundation, is action-oriented and eager to learn, and shares our passion for the Code for America mission and our focus on helping users. We work with well-known and reliable technologies like Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL, but we don't require prior expertise in our stack. You'll learn to confidently develop and ship software in our environment as you progress through your apprenticeship.

## So, what do we do?

Our teams work on a variety of problems facing people at risk of persistent poverty and incarceration, including food security, healthcare, employment, and criminal justice reform. We work hand in hand with public servants to identify and remove barriers within these systems so people can get the services they need. We do this by taking a user-centered, data-driven, and iterative approach to service delivery, and we believe this approach can be a massive force for social good.

- Participate fully in all team activities.
- Learn about the service delivery challenges in a policy area and how a user-centered, - data-driven, iterative approach to technology can help.
- Ship software that helps users more easily navigate government services.
- Write automated tests and work on infrastructure to ensure a high level of service quality.
- Pair with your teammates to design and deliver clean, reliable, and maintainable solutions to user problems.
- Use lean product development practices to implement the simplest thing that could work, and continuously improve the product from there.

# Amazon - Apprenticeships for the Military Community

https://blog.aboutamazon.com/working-at-amazon/first-class-of-veteran-apprentices-graduate-into-amazon-jobs

https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/mil-apprentice

In 2017, the Amazon Veteran Technical Apprenticeship (AVTA) program started in Seattle with a small cohort of veterans looking for new careers. The cohort was made up of veterans including a former combat medic, military signal support, and an engineering dive officer.

The AVTA program is divided into two section of training. The veterans started by entering into intensive classroom training with Apprenti and then moved into on-the-job, paid apprenticeships with Amazon. This model fills in key technical skill gaps and offers participants an opportunity to learn on the job in high-demand fields.

In August 2018, the first graduating cohort of on-the-job apprentices became full-time Cloud Support Associates at Amazon.

We sat down with Joshua Tanton, one of those new graduates, to ask him about the program and why it is important for veterans and military spouses.

## Here's what to do next:

- Apply to the role below that most interests you.
- Next, you’ll be screened by an agency based on eligibility criteria (register here).
- If you're selected, you’ll be interviewed by Amazon.
- If the interview is successful, you’ll receive 8-24 weeks of paid full-time training in high-demand technical skills, followed by up to 12 months of paid on-the-job training.

## This is what we're looking for:

Military experience in communications, intelligence, cyber-security OR industry-recognized IT certifications (i.e. Linux+, A+, Net+).

Active military within last 6 months of service, Guard/Reserve members, Veterans, and Military Spouses.

Active clearances.

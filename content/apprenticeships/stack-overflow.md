description: 'Stack Overflow''s Web Developer Apprentice is an 11-week apprenticeship program where you''ll work directly alongside a developer mentor on a real product team. Rather than doing independent "intern" projects that may not ever ship, as an apprentice you''ll work with your mentor to learn, review, debug, and ship features to real users. You''ll also work collaboratively with other members of the team, including other developers, designers, and product managers.'

Jellyvision’s love of teaching and entertaining goes back decades, to when we were making educational videos, games like You Don’t Know Jack, and not as much money. Around the turn of the century, we began applying our expertise to solving communications challenges.

To help people understand their benefits, we design interactive experiences based on proven behavioral science principles, and we personalize our products to make them relevant to each individual user. We make them fun, too, because extensive research has shown that people make their best decisions when their eyeballs have not dried out from boredom.

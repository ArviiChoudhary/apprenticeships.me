Quora's mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge. We're building a platform that allows anyone to get the best answer to any question. As a team, we are dedicated to holding high standards, developing a strong and passionate culture, and emphasizing impact.

Quora’s Software Engineering Apprentice Program is a 6-month paid opportunity for passionate, aspiring software engineers from a non-traditional background to gain the knowledge, tools, and skills to thrive as a software engineer.

In your role as an apprentice, you’ll take on important projects that help drive the company and product forward. We believe that high impact projects are the best way to grow and develop your skills. You may work in areas such as:

Mobile: mobile apps are our most important platforms for user engagement! Work with designers and data scientists to build smooth mobile app product interactions that are performant and reliable for great daily use.

Frontend Platform: enable productivity and innovation of our frontend developers, through building frontend tools, building blocks, and frameworks to power the Quora product on all platforms — web, mobile web, iOS, and Android. We are currently modernizing our frontend stack!

Core Product: build out and scale user-facing product features to drive engagement and help the product grow.

We believe in mentorship that will accelerate your growth and help you develop strong engineering practices. Throughout the apprenticeship, you will work closely with your mentor and the rest of your team. You’ll receive feedback through coaching, code reviews, and one on one meetings; and broaden your learning through engineering tech talks, reading groups, and our culture of awareness. The program includes a mid-point formal evaluation of your progress. At the end of the program, based on your progress, we will consider you for a full-time Software Engineer role.

Engineering Apprentice
Learn from our great team and work with our amazing roster of clients.
The Role
Upstatement is seeking interested applicants for our Engineering Apprenticeship program! Being an apprentice at Upstatement means there’s less coffee-fetching and more git fetching.

This is a paid position where you will gain valuable experience in the fast-paced world of digital consulting, paired with a mastery of team communication and charged-up engineering skills.

Now for some bullets:
We work with high-profile clients, tech startups and experimental projects
We play at least as hard as we work
We are excited about new ideas and love to share
Do I qualify?
As a true member of the Upstatement team during your Apprenticeship tenure, some experience in what we do (and how we do it) is necessary. If you are a student in a multi-year CS or digital media program, or if you have similar apprenticeships under your belt already, we’d love to chat.

This is about more than code. Join us to see what kinds of opportunities await you.

About the department
Check out our Engineers page to learn a bit more about the technology department, read some blog posts, and figure out what makes our engineers tick.

How long does the apprenticeship last?
Our apprenticeships are usually a 6-month full-time commitment. We’ve found 6 months to be the sweet spot for both you and us to get the most out of your apprenticeship. It’s enough time for you to get comfortable, learn, practice, and contribute.

Is there a job at the end of the apprenticeship?
Hiring decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. Your performance, our hiring needs, and your desire to continue working for Upstatement would all be taken into account. In short, it’s possible but not a guarantee.

Do I have to be in college?
Nope! We welcome current students (typically junior year or later), people who are a few years out of school, people who are making a career change, and those who are self-taught.

Is it paid?
Yes! All of our apprentices are paid in real cash money.

Interested in applying?
